Technical Objectives
The primary goal of this lab is to establish a secure, version-controlled workbench using VS Code and Git. By implementing an APA-formatted documentation structure, I am ensuring all technical artifacts meet professional GRC reporting standards.

Security Foundations: Governance & Frameworks
The CIA Triad
The CIA Triad serves as a core model designed to guide policies for information security within an organization. Confidentiality ensures that sensitive information is accessed only by authorized users, while Integrity focuses on protecting data from unauthorized modification to maintain its accuracy. Availability completes the triad by ensuring that systems and data are consistently accessible to authorized users whenever they are needed.

The AAA Framework
The AAA Framework provides a structured approach to managing access control and accountability. Authentication is the process of verifying a user's identity, often through passwords or tokens, whereas Authorization determines the specific permissions and access levels granted to that user. Finally, Accounting involves tracking and recording user activity and resource consumption, which is essential for forensic auditing and compliance reporting.

Governance and Cybersecurity Roles
Governance provides the strategic roadmap that defines how an organization protects its assets, ensuring that security measures align with business goals and legal requirements. It affects cybersecurity roles by establishing the policies, standards, and procedures that practitioners must follow, transforming technical tasks into repeatable, legally defensible processes. Without governance, technical roles operate in a vacuum without clear accountability or risk management priorities.

 Reflection
Governance is just as important as technical skill because it provides the "why" and "how" behind the "what" of security operations. While a technician can patch a server, governance determines which servers are high-priority based on risk to the organization. In cybersecurity, technical skills are the tools, but governance is the blueprint that ensures those tools are used effectively and legally. Without strong documentation and policy, even the best technical defenses can fail during a regulatory audit or legal challenge. Today’s material aligns most closely with the Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) domain. This domain focuses specifically on the intersection of technical security controls and organizational policy, ensuring all actions meet professional reporting standards.
